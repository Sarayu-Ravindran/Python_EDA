Video Game Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

The Objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of video game sales to provide insights into sales trends, market dynamics, and factors influencing video game popularity across different regions. The analysis should help understand the relationships between various attributes and guide strategic decisions for stakeholders in the gaming industry, such as game developers, marketers, and investors.

Through the analysis of visualizations, we can conclude that production of games in the past 40 years has arisen to peak in 2008 but there has been a downfall since then due to increase in the production of smart phones through which various games can be played.
